		<h1>What Are Puppy Mills?</h1>
		<p><dfn>Puppy mills</dfn> are places that irresponsibly breed animals. It is most often dogs, but can easily be many different species. Often the animals bred in that facility are very diseased, and/or have severe problems such as hip and elbow dysplasia or mange,a painful skin disease. These animals are emotionally and physically scarred for the rest of their lives, but it doesn't have to be this way. If you see a puppy mill, you should always report it to the local animal control. You can also help by donating to rescue groups, adopting dogs from shelters, and coming to the Puppy Power 5k.</p>
